                <h1>About Ethan Fife</h1>
                <p>
                Ethan Fife is a student at Granada Highschool.
                He has spent enough time in extra extracurricular taking place on a college campus to earn a "Certificate of Adequacy". 
                When he isn't busy not doing his work, he can be found reading, gaming, or even just thinking.
                He is currently creating the very website your reading. 
                You can message him at the email below, but I guarantee he wont check it.
